Tic Tac Toe Game

Overview

This project is an Object-Oriented Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java. It utilizes AI powered by the Minimax algorithm to compute optimal moves for the computer player. The game provides a console-based interface for user interaction, allowing players to make their moves and compete against the computer.

Features

Minimax Algorithm: Implements AI for making optimal moves by predicting future game states.
Console Interaction: Users can play the game directly through console input.
Standard Java Libraries: Utilizes basic Java functionalities for game logic and display.
Installation


How to Play

The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid.
Players (human as 'X' and computer as 'O') take turns placing their marks on the board.
The computer's move is determined using the Minimax algorithm to maximize its chances of winning while minimizing the player's.
